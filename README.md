# springboot-mybatis-kotlin

## Brief

This project is powered by kotlin and gradle deps management.

Its a demo for kotlin-dsl, I use kotlin instead of groovy to manage gradle
project. Now its just a solution of springboot1.x with spring4.x, I'll update
it in the future perhaps.

## Feature

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* kotlin-dsl
* springboot
